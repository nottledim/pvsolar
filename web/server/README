These files are used to access the pv data from mysql and transorm it
into a json data object. You can test from your browser by surfing to:

http://your.site.com/pvdata.php?pv=day&date=today
http://your.site.com/pvdata.php?pv=sum

If you use Firefox you can pretty-print the json data returned using
an AddOn - I use JSONovich but there are others.

Place these files on you web server where php can access them but
preferably *not* in document root.  Either symlink pvdata.php to your
document root of create a simple php script which includes pvdata.php

e.g:

<?php
  
include "../pvdata.php"; 

?>

Edit pv_config.php.inc to suit your site.  You need to give mysql
access details and a couple of localisations.  If you are serving for
more than one site you need separate versions of pv_config.inc but the
other scripts may be shared.
